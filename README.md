# CarTrackTechTask
This is my submission for the CarTrack Tech Task that is part of the interview process.

The task was to create an Android app that is a miniature version of the IMDB app.

## Technical decisions made
I tried to use as much techical approaches that are recommended by Google. Some of these decisions are listed below:
- MVVM for the architecture
- The repository pattern to pull data into ViewModels
- Retrofit to make API calls
- Hilt for Dependency Injection
- NavComponent for displaying and navigating between fragments
- LiveData for updating the UI
